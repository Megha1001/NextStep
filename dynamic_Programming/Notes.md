- Its an optimization over plain recursion
- Idea is to reuse the solution of subproblems when there are overlapping subproblems
- Types
    - Memoization(top down)
    - Tabulation(bottom up)
- Applications of DP
    - Bellman Ford Algorithm
    - Floyd Warshall algorithm
    - Diff Utility(LCS (Longest common subsequence))
    - Search closed words(Edit distance)
    - Resource Allocation(0-1 knapsnack)
